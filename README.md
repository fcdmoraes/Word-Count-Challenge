# Word Count Challenge

This challenge was solved using HTML and JavaScript, is compatible with most browsers and runs in any OS, 
including phone devices. It, however, requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser. If you don't know how

*Assumptions:* the program only counts words composed of at least one alphanumerical character from the Latin 
alphabet, including accented letters. Each word must be separated from another one by spaces or linebreaks.

*Language choice:* While I could solve this challenge using Node.js or Django, problem simplicity suggests 
using a more basic structure. The solution in JavaScript has high portability and does not require installation 
procedures. The use of bootstrap allows fast interface design without compromising either portability or 
performance.
